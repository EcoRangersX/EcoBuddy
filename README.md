# EcoBuddy

## Mission
Our goal is to create a **mobile app** that not only helps users expand their knowledge of ecology through quizzes integrated into the app but also uses the **latest technology** to maximize their productivity in learning about the environment and alerts users to **air pollution** levels in the vicinity.

People have become more aware of the **importance of ecology** and the environment, and we want to help them learn more about it and take care of it.

**AI-Assistant** is aiming to help users get the immediate feedback and personalized learning experience they need to improve their knowledge of ecology and the environment.

Note: The frontend structure is outdated and needs to be updated
