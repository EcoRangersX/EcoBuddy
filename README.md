# EcoBuddy

## Mission
Our goal is to create a **mobile app** that not only helps users expand their knowledge of ecology through quizzes integrated into the app but also uses the **latest technology** to maximize their productivity in learning about the environment. Our app alerts users about **air pollution** levels in the vicinity.

People have become more aware of the **importance of ecology** and the environment, and we want to help them learn more about it and take care of it.

**EcoBuddy AI** is aiming to help users get the immediate feedback and personalized learning experience they need to improve their knowledge about ecology and the environment.

## TODO: Add instructions on how to run the entire project with the Docker
