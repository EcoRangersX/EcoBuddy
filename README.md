# EcoBuddy

Our goal is to create a mobile app that not only helps users expand their knowledge of ecology through quizzes integrated into the app but also uses the latest technology to maximize their productivity in learning about the environment and alerts users to air pollution levels in the vicinity.

People have become more aware of the importance of ecology and the environment, and we want to help them learn more about it and take care of it.

AI-Assistant is aiming to help users get the immediate feedback and personalized learning experience they need to improve their knowledge of ecology and the environment.
