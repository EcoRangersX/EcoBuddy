# Welcome to the Frontend of the EcoBuddy ðŸ‘‹

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Rename `.env.dist` file to `.env` and fill in the required field.

3. The easiest way to see the application is to install **Expo Go** from Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent). For more information on how to install Expo Go on your emulator/simulator you can find [here](https://expo.dev/go)

4. Once you have installed Expo Go on your phone or emulator/simulator you can run the following command to start the application.

   _Note_: Make sure you have the backend running before starting the frontend.

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

5. Scan the QR code that you see in the terminal or enter the URL manually in the Expo Go app.

6. You are all set to use the application ðŸŽ‰
